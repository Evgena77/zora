# Recipes list

A list of example projects with various dev environments: 

* [simple node library written as an ecmascript module](./node-es)
* [simple node library written in typescript](./node-ts)

You should usually have a look at the ``scripts`` section of the package.json files to find out how to run the tests, the dev mode, the coverage, etc. There are often alternative scripts and examples as well
